## Final Project Proposal

### 1. Abstract

*In a few sentences, describe your final project.*

Our final project will be a custom hot wheels booster/launcher that is programmed to detect and land a jump of variable distance. The microcontroller will use a camera and ultrasonic sensor to determine the distance and orientation of the jump, using servo motors to rotate the booster and angle the ramp. It will use a dc motor to spin rubber wheels which will accelerate the car off of the ramp at a calculated speed in order to land the jump.

### 2. Motivation

*What is the problem that you are trying to solve? Why is this project interesting? What is the intended purpose?*

Children around the world take up various common interests as they age. Many of these hobbies revolve around toys produced by mega-conglomerates, many of which pale in comparison to the fascinating world of Hot Wheelsâ„¢. Kids dream of designing the coolest track, with tight twists and turns, loops, and most importantly, jumps. However, designing the perfect jump is an extraordinarily difficult task to do manually. One must have perfect aim, take into consideration the speed of the car as it becomes airborne, and control the angle of incidence as the wheels depart from the track. This is further limited by the speed of the Hot Wheelsâ„¢ booster, which has no flexibility for adjustments. We begin the undertaking of our final project with the goal of constructing a booster which not only allows for adjustment of its speed, but will automatically adjust the aim of its track so that the Hot Wheelsâ„¢ car will subsequently land the desired jump. This is interesting because it will entail fine-tuned motor control in order to land the jump, and requires appropriate input capture to determine where the desired endpoint of the jump is located.

### 3. System Block Diagram

*Show your high level design, as done in WS1 and WS2. What are the critical components in your system? How do they communicate (I2C?, interrupts, ADC, etc.)? What power regulation do you need?*

![image](blockdiagram.png)

### 4. Design Sketches

*What will your project look like? Do you have any critical design features? Will you need any special manufacturing techniques to achieve your vision, like power tools, laser cutting, or 3D printing?*

![image](sketch.jpg)

The wheels and gears for the booster will be 3D printed, as well as the attachments for the servos. The mounts for the ramp and the base of the contraption, as well as the attachments for the camera, ultrasonic sensor, etc. will be laser cut.

### 5. Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

*Formulate key software requirements here. Think deeply on the design: What must your device do? How will you measure this during validation testing? Create 4 to 8 critical system requirements.*

*These must be testable! See the Final Project Manual Appendix for details. Refer to the table below; replace these examples with your own.*

**5.1 Definitions, Abbreviations**

Target - tape of a unique color attached to the end ramp that will be used to aim the on-ramp.

Vertical rotation servo - the servo attached to the on-ramp that angles it up and down.

Horizontal rotation servo - the servo mounted to the base that rotates the entire booster left and right.

**5.2 Functionality**

| ID     | Description                                                                                                                                                                     |
|--------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| SRS-01 | The microcontroller shall read from the OV7670 camera over I2C every 0.5 seconds.                                                                                               |
| SRS-02 | The microcontroller shall control the angles of the horizontal and vertical rotational servos in a feedback loop with the camera data.                                          |
| SRS-03 | The feedback loop in SRS-02 will exit when the target is in the correct position in the camera frame, at which point the microcontroller will send a trigger to the ultrasonic sensor. |
| SRS-04 | The microcontroller will have input capture on the echo pin of the ultrasonic sensor to measure distance to the target.                                                         |
| SRS-05 | ADC will be used to read from reflective IR sensor. When it reads below a threshold value, the microcontroller will actuate the servo that holds the car in place.                               |
| SRS-06 | The microcontroller will send a PWM signal, the duty cycle of which will control the speed of the DC motor based on a predetermined equation that takes as input how far the jump is. |


### 6. Hardware Requirements Specification (HRS)

*Formulate key hardware requirements here. Think deeply on the design: What must your device do? How will you measure this during validation testing? Create 4 to 8 critical system requirements.*

*These must be testable! See the Final Project Manual Appendix for details. Refer to the table below; replace these examples with your own.*

**6.1 Definitions, Abbreviations**

Custom buck converter: consists of a MOSFET, diode, inductor, and capacitor used to regulate the voltage driving the DC motor.

**6.2 Functionality**

| ID     | Description                                                                                                                        |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| HRS-01 | A camera shall be used to find the target ramp. The resolution shall be 240x240 or higher.|
| HRS-02 | A IR sensor shall be used to determine if a car is ready to enter the launcher. It will inform the processor using an analog signal. |
| HRS-03 | A custom buck converter will step down 12V to a lower voltage given PWM from the processor. This stepped down output shall be used to power the motor. |
| HRS-04 | An ultrasonic sensor shall be used to find the distance to the target ramp. The range of the ultrasonic sensor should be at least 300cm (for reasonably rad jumps). |
| HRS-05 | A servo will be used to adjust the ramp height up and down. A similar servo will be used to hold the car in place, then rotate to allow the car into the launcher. |
| HRS-06 | A servo will be used to adjust the assembly left and right. |

### 7. Bill of Materials (BOM)

*What major components do you need and why? Try to be as specific as possible. Your Hardware & Software Requirements Specifications should inform your component choices.*

Camera - Used to find the target ramp, and used to provide feedback for steering the launcher ramp to aim at target.

Ultrasonic Sensor - Required to determine the distance the ramp is, which will determine speed of motor rotation.

IR Sensor - Used to determine when a car has been placed on the ramp, informing the system that it needs to turn on.

Motor - Used to generate speed for flywheel to launch car.

Servos - One to rotate ramp up/down, one to rotate assembly left/right. These two are for aiming at the ramp. One to keep the car in place/let it go into the launcher.

5V Power pack - Used to power servos and ATmega328PB.

12V 23A batteries - Used to provide power to the motor. 

Components for a buck converter (Transistor, inductor, capacitor) - Used to make buck converter. Ideally, these will be Detkin components. Not super on board with using a buck converter IC and soldering a dozen SMD parts...

*In addition to this written response, copy the Final Project BOM Google Sheet and fill it out with your critical components (think: processors, sensors, actuators). Include the link to your BOM in this section.*

### 8. Final Demo Goals

*How will you demonstrate your device on demo day? Will it be strapped to a person, mounted on a bicycle, require outdoor space? Think of any physical, temporal, and other constraints that could affect your planning.*

Device will be demonstrated on the floor, in some area, where we can set up the hotwheels ramps. The launcher will launch a car successfully onto the target ramp. We would need to set up somewhere less populated, in order to not impede foot traffic, or otherwise demo at a time when the building is less populated.

### 9. Sprint Planning

*You've got limited time to get this project done! How will you plan your sprint milestones? How will you distribute the work within your team? Review the schedule in the final project manual for exact dates.*

### Next week's plan

Reprint gears

Configure camera (Raspi + comm with ATmega) (Camera gotten did not work)

Tweak buck converter to ensure proper operation

Make sure buck does not fry ATmega (back voltage / ground shenanigans)

Get motor to spin gears

## Sprint Review #2

### Last week's progress

Turns out the buck converter was a waste of time; Switched to PWM as BJT gate for power modulation.

Got the motors on the launcher, they work!

Got ball bearings attached

Used ATmega to generate PWM signal to spin motors: car launched. 

Car acceleration confirmed.

Raspi has program that can find bounding box for given color. 

ATmega should be able to interface with the ultrasonic device.

Precise control of servos, interfacing with IR sensor works.

### Current state of project

### Next week's plan

Launch car using higher power (were using the Detkin power supply, which has low(er) limits (than the wall adapter we plan on using))

Get SPI working so we can send bounding box to ATmega.

Perfboard for all the motor powering stuff (and maybe all the sensors)

Integration of sensors.
